# Bouncing balls
This program is a simulation of the behaviour of balls in a closed environment, using the SFML library for graphics purposes.

You can add a ball and give it an initial speed by left clicking and dragging in the window:

It uses Euler integration to calculate a ball trajectory, and a quadtree to avoid an o(nÂ²) collision detection algorithm:

Collision with the walls and balls is handled.

It also handles inelastic collisions and gravity effect:
